# SelfGrowth â€“ Online Self Development Platform
## Project Summary 
During the pandemic period, people's interests or desire to explore new areas are increasing, but finding materials and trainers has become increasingly difficult. In this period, people's orientation to MOOC (Udemy, edX etc.) platforms has increased noticeably. However, the fact that the trainings on these platforms are generally formed, not tailored for the specific learner or not in the form of live training creates difficulties for the person who wants to improve himself. Another type of platforms that has increased in use during the pandemic period are platforms like Cambly which lessons are online. However, the problem here is that the pricing of programs like Cambly does not fit every segments of society. The aim of the project to be developed is to determine the criteria that the learner wants and to match the learner-instructor suitable for him. Among the listed results, the learner will be able to choose the most suitable instructor and start working in the field he wants to improve. Finding instructors and student-instructor compliance can be achieved more easily in SelfGrowth application which has a rating system.
